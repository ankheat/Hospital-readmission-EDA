This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on patient admissions and treatment outcomes, uncovering trends in diagnoses, length of hospital stays, and recovery rates. Through visualizations and statistical insights, the analysis aids in hospital resource planning and treatment optimization.

## Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Summary statistics and data distribution

Visualizations for key trends

Insights on patient demographics and treatment effectiveness

Correlation analysis between variables

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

Patient Information: Age, gender, diagnosis

Admission Details: Admission date, Discharge Date

Outcome Data: Treatment Outcome

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy

## Usage
